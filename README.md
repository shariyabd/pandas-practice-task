# Pandas Practice Tasks

## Level 1: Basic
**Goal:** Learn to read, explore, and manipulate data

- Create a DataFrame of students with columns: `name`, `age`, `marks`.
- Print the first 5 rows.
- Print only `name` and `marks`.
- Filter students with `marks > 80`.
- Load a CSV file (or create dummy data). Example: `sales.csv` with `product`, `quantity`, `price`.
- Find total sales for each product.
- Add a new column `total = quantity * price`.
- Sort products by total sales.
- Create a Series with temperatures `[30, 32, 28, 25, 27]` for 5 days.
- Convert temperatures from Celsius â†’ Fahrenheit.
- Find max, min, mean temperatures.

## Level 2: Intermediate (Data Cleaning & Analysis)
**Goal:** Work with missing values, grouping, and aggregations

- Create a DataFrame `employees.csv` with `id`, `name`, `department`, `salary`.
- Fill missing salaries with the average salary.
- Find highest paid employee.
- Group by `department` and calculate average salary.
- Use the Titanic dataset: `sns.load_dataset("titanic")`
  - Find how many passengers survived.
  - Show average age by class (`pclass`).
  - Find survival rate by gender (`sex`).
- From a dataset of marks (`name`, `subject`, `marks`):
  - Find average marks per student.
  - Find the student with highest total marks.
